I am Stefano, a researcher specializing in **computational methods for nuclear reactors**. My work focuses on developing advanced numerical techniques, reduced order models, and machine learning approaches to enhance the efficiency, safety, and predictability of reactor simulations.

I am currently affiliated with Politecnico di Milano, where I conduct research on topics such as reduced order modelling and data-driven techniques for reactor dynamics. My research often combines high-performance computing with machine learning methods to tackle complex problems in nuclear engineering, mainly focused on the state estimation problem in nuclear reactors.

**Title:** Advanced Data-Driven Techniques for State Estimation in Nuclear Reactors

**Supervisors:** Prof. Antonio Cammi, Dr. Carolina Introini, Prof. J. Nathan Kutz



I got a PhD in Nuclear Engineering in 2025 at *Politecnico di Milano* (Italy), focused on the development of fast, reliable, and data-driven **state estimation techniques for nuclear reactors**, with a particular emphasis on next-generation concepts such as molten-salt systems. These reactors pose significant sensing challenges due to their harsh operating environments, making traditional in-core measurements difficult or impossible.

To address this, my research investigated how to infer the full reactor state from **few, sparse, and often indirect sensor observations**, combining them with physics-based background models described by parametric PDEs within a **Data Assimilation framework** combined with **Reduced Order Modelling (ROM)** to enable real-time computation. Classical ROM approaches—such as GEIM and the Parametrized-Background Data-Weak formulation—were explored, as well as advanced data-driven methods capable of correcting model inaccuracies. Building on recent developments in Scientific Machine Learning, I extensively studied the **Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED)** architecture, a lightweight neural network framework capable of handling nonlinear dynamics, parametric datasets, and complex reactor behaviour with minimal training effort.

These techniques were validated on several challenging case studies, including:
- Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR)
- TRIGA Mark II research reactor
- Fluid-dynamics benchmarks
- The DYNASTY experimental facility at Politecnico di Milano

The results demonstrate the strong potential of ROM-based and machine-learning-based state estimation methods for future **digital twins** of nuclear systems, ultimately supporting safer and more efficient reactor operation.
